Spam Detection using Machine Learning

Overview

This project builds a spam detection model using machine learning techniques. It processes a dataset of emails and classifies them as spam or not spam using text-based features and classification models.

Dataset

The dataset is loaded from mail_data.csv.
It contains email messages and their labels (spam or not spam).
Missing values are handled appropriately.
Requirements

Install the necessary dependencies using:

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
Steps Covered

Data Loading & Preprocessing
Reads the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
Replaces missing values.
Feature Extraction
Uses TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into numerical features.
Model Training
Trains a Logistic Regression model for spam classification.
Evaluation
Computes accuracy to assess model performance.
Usage

Open and run Spam_detection.ipynb step by step.
Modify preprocessing or model parameters as needed.
Evaluate results and experiment with different classifiers.
Future Improvements

Experiment with different machine learning models (SVM, Na√Øve Bayes, etc.).
Use deep learning techniques like LSTMs or Transformers for better accuracy.
